Messy list of ideas / bugs / various notes.

unique_ptr rebind seems incomplete
Support cycles through shared_ptr&, unique_ptr&... 
Topo-sort during destruction
Expose type instances and letting users reset the ones that are stable, creating a state pattern. This creates interesting threading issues and can benefit from container nesting.
Resolving multiple implementations of some interface in a vector, map with custom key extractor, ...
Thread safety - safe read / unsafe write, or finer locking
Resolvability test, is_constructible should be enough to find out if container will resolve without exceptions
Suport custom allocators for type map
Container nesting
