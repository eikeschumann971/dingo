Messy list of ideas / bugs / various notes.

RegisterBindings does now work for abstract classes
TypeInstances that cannot live in factory can live in the context object or use a custom allocator
unique_ptr rebind seems incomplete
Cycle detection, later can be support through shared_ptr&, unique_ptr&... 
Topo-sort during destruction
Expose type instances and letting users reset the ones that are stable, creating a state pattern. This creates interesting threading issues and can benefit from container nesting.
Resolving multiple implementations of some interface in a vector, map with custom key extractor, ...
Thread safety - safe read / unsafe write, or finer locking
Resolvability test, is_constructible should be enough to find out if container will resolve without exceptions
Allocator for instances, types map and rest of the instance work
Exception safety, I would have to somehow resolve on different container and merge after successful resolve
